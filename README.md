# Multi-threaded-Key-Value-Store-using-RPC
For this project, you will extend Project #1 in two distinct ways.
1) You need to enable your client and server to communicate using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
instead of sockets. If youâ€™ve implemented Project #1 in Java, you may want to look into and leverage
Java RMI for RPC communication. However, there are multiple other RPC frameworks you can
leverage (with their own IDLs) to provide the stubs/skeletons necessary across the network. An
additional example that enables the use of multiple languages is Apache Thrift (http://thrift.apache.org/
(Links to an external site.)
2) You need to make your server multi-threaded such that you can handle multiple outstanding client
requests at once. You may decide how to thread your server. One approach may be to use thread pools
similar to other servers, although there are certainly many ways to do this. The key result is that your
servers should be able to handle requests from multiple running instances of you client doing concurrent
PUT, GET, and DELETE operations. Due to the addition of multi-threading, you will need to handle
mutual exclusion.
As in project #1, you should use your client to pre-populate the Key-Value store with data and a set of
keys. The composition of data is up to you in terms of what you want to store. Once the key-value
store is populated, your client must do at least 5 of each operation: 5 PUTs, 5 GETs, 5 DELETEs.
